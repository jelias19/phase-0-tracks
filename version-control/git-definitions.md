# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system that allows you to manage changes to files at different periods of time.  It is useful because it lets you look back at old files, and track progress throughout time. If a mistake is made, you can look back and revert to old code.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a seperate place to do work, away from the master file. This allows you to collaborate on code with others and bring files back together. In addition, it isolates work that we do and if code doesn't work, you can discard it. 


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you are storing the code in a repository. You are ready to save a copy of the work you are doing. A good commit message is one that explains what was done and modified. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when you have commits in one branch, that are not replicated in another branch. Essentially, there are changes that do not align with one another.
