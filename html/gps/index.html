<!--Personal Reflection

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

	Semantic tags define the content within the tag. They give an idea of what type of content to expect within a given Semantic tag and the meaning of the section. All Semantic tags will be useful as we develop more complext sites, but I do see <nav> being very useful as we link pages. I also feel   
	<header> and <footer> tags will play a big factor to help me structure pages. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

	The browser determines how to display elements on a page based on the files in the HTML and CSS specs. The data goes through whats called a rendering engine to analyze the code and construct the layout and painting of the page, HTML and CSS respectively. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

	I learned that you can create your own snippets in Sublime which can save you a lot of time as you are writing code. Being able to just hit the tab key as you start to type text to complete code will be useful as we learn more and want to use quicker and faster shorthand. I knew about snippets before, but not that you can customize them. 


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

	I'd say the concept in this challenge that gave me the most diffuiculty was just understand where the various Semantic Elements should be on a page, and how they coinside with one another. I need to get a better grasp of which semenatic elements should be nested within one another, and which do not.
